🌍 AbroadEduIndia:
AbroadEduIndia is a website built by our team to assist students in exploring, sorting, and narrowing down their options for studying at colleges abroad.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
Please do not try to run the code directly from this repository.
It is currently a work-in-progress and not fully functional in its current state. Stay tuned for upcoming updates! Plus, this is a just normal and incomplete project.

If you're interested in checking out the live version, it's already deployed!

📝 Note:
At this stage, I’ve uploaded all my work in one place without organizing it yet. Some images and videos used in the project may also be missing for now. Proper folder structure and resource management will be added soon.
